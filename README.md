## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of the IKEA furniture database. The analysis includes exploring the data, testing hypotheses, and developing a model to predict furniture prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IKEA furniture database, which contains information about various furniture items, including attributes such as price, dimensions, materials, and more. The database is provided in a structured format and is compatible with standard data analysis tools.

## Project Steps
### Database Loading: 
Download and ensure the compatibility of the IKEA furniture database.
### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Perform descriptive statistics and visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.
### Hypothesis Testing: 
Select and test two hypotheses based on the EDA and common sense.
### Furniture Price Prediction Model:
Determine the columns to be excluded from the model and explain the reasons.
Create a pipeline for cross-validation, including necessary preprocessing steps.
Propose methods for enhancing the model's performance.
Present the results and evaluate the model's accuracy and limitations.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the IKEA furniture database, including EDA, hypothesis testing, and price prediction modeling. The findings and insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for understanding the dataset and making informed decisions related to furniture pricing and trends.
